<<<<<<IMPORTANT>>>>>>>>
NOTE: Need to destroy powerup object ref after being used or dropped(its still attached to the sports car)
<<<<<<IMPORTANT DONT FORGET>>>>>>>>



TODO: add zoom in effect function on the sports car and then call in on the powerup using interface
	that interface is added to DeathRaceSportsCar c++ and overridden in the blueprint 
	this interface takes a bool input and triggers either zoom in or zoom out functions respectively
	create function that triggers this start zoom when boost powerup used
	create another function to zoom end when boost powerup is ended
	Dont forget to delete powerup actor attached to character after drop powerup too
